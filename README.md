# Readify
Readify is a digital library UI mockup created using Axure RP, designed to offer a seamless and accessible user experience for exploring and borrowing books online. The interface features a clean navigation bar with search, sign-in, language options, and a night mode toggle. It highlights trending and classic books in interactive carousels, each showing real-time availability with labels like "Borrow," "Checked Out," and "Preview Only." This mockup demonstrates a modern, user-focused layout suitable for library platforms or educational resource hubs.
